I'm Yaswanth Reddy Mandapati, a Computer Science graduate student.It gives me immense pleasure to introduce myself to you.
Through the Smartinternz website and also at Cognizant, I have completed a couple internships. Which I used to gain deep understanding about how things function in practice. Web applications, Databases, and Machine Learning formed the foundation of my internships and projects. I am capable of managing and developing projects that have a high degree of temporal complexity. Additionally, I am a strong manager of team projects.
I am well-versed in HTML, CSS, and Java Script, which I need to construct online apps and manage databases.
I'm proficient at using backend systems. Putting this aside, I finished a couple courses in Python and C through Coursera, IBM, and the University of Michigan. I am therefore acquainted with those coding languages.
I have a lot of faith that this training will undoubtedly pave the way for the development of both my talents and my career. And finally, I am eager to begin the project with my team mates.
Thank you!!
Yaswanth Reddy Mandapati.
